## 🗃️ MLH: Best Use of Appwrite

One of the reasons we were able to quickly build such a difficult technical project was that we significantly relied on Appwrite. We connected with our database, Appwrite DB. We used Appwrite as a second layer of caching. With this strategy, we use computation and storage more effectively to provide our software's users with a lightning-fast experience. In DB collections, we connected the login and usage history of our users. Because of Appwrite's relatively straightforward user interface, it was fun to use.

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

I have used GitHub for the reasons listed below:

- Setting up the project: Starting a project on GitHub couldn't be simpler.
- GitHub Project: To plan and monitor the development of our project utilizing GitHub projects.
- Utilizing PRs and Issues: In order to keep the project on track, we are creating numerous PRs and issues.
